cmd.fm console interface
========================

This a very poor and basic console interface for the http://cmd.fm/. It's
incomplete, but it works... for now.

Why?
~~~~

It was a boring night. My attempts to go out with girls failed and I someone
said somewhere about http://cmd.fm/. Then I was like: "why not a REAL console
interface (or something local at least)?". Well, that's why.

How?
~~~~

Reverse engineering.

I did this project for fun. If the developers of cmd.fm request, I'll take it
down. I'm not connected to them at all, so don't expect this to work and don't
ask them for support. I might eventually discontinue this if I don't have time
anymore. Bla bla bla, you got the idea! :)

Finally, please, if you like this, make sure to check the original and better
service: http://cmd.fm/.
